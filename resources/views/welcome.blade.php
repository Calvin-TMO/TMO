                    <p>Welcome to Calvin's Tutoring Management Overhaul (TMO) project, developed and supported by Benjamin Braker, Mark Vander Stel, and Carson Wiens.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of this site is to provide a better streamline process for tutors to submit reports detailing what they and their students have covered during one of their tutoring session. Once submitted professors will be able to view and comment on these reports increasing the cooperation and communication between the tutor and the professor hopefully increasing the effectiveness of the overall tutoring process.</p>
                    <p>If this is your first time to the site please register for a new account and inform the tutoring department of your status (i.e. tutor or professor). If you are a student future tools will be added to allow you to request a tutor via this site, but in the mean time you must pick-up and fill out a tutor request form from the tutoring office.</p>
                    <p>If you already have an account please login to use the features of this site.</p>
